C++
* Detach detours? Is this even worth doing?
* Fix hook system - use pointers to avoid map copies - This shouldn't need to be done, check C++ move semantics.
* Fix the MAJOR PROBLEM in hook system - probably can just search for the virtual function on deletion
* Benchmark and analyse Widen/Narrow functions
* Replace slow DirectX font rendering with something faster
* Remake object searching to use the hash table
* The whole namespace thing is getting a bit messy, might need to think about using a class

Lua
* Implement checking that controls have not been freed before acting on them
* Figure out what the fuck is going wrong with UObjectIndex
* Allow for return values to be passed from a ProcessEvent hook back into the engine
* FFrame.GetFuncArgsHex possible infinite loop
* FFrameMT.GetTArray does not take into account TArray inner type
* Get the SDKGen to run on coroutines so maybe we can render something to tell the user about the sdk generating
* Add __tostring for structs
* Complete file library (unload for the moment)
* Figure out what's going on with FTurnData
* SDKGen: Properly prefix event functions with event
* Fix LocalPlayerController finding - probably need to grab it out of GEngine->GamePlayers and then check when it changes using Actor:eventDestroyed

Other
* CrashRpt endpoint on mcsi.mp
* CrashRpt privacy policy
* Lua/C++: Get the function flags right for ProcessEvent
* Add launcher facility to decompress upk files for opening in UE Explorer
* Organise the SDK folder a bit better -subfolder for gwen textures etc.
* Find some way to move Launcher source code out of the build folder
* Decide whether to release source code (If so, hide some Unreal structs that I really shouldn't know)
* Look into a build server and symbol server for crash reporting

Bugs:
* Cursor does not work correctly in full screen - I think it's fine in borderless windowed though
* Tabs in Unreal console are fucked
