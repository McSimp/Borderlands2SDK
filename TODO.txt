* Automatic version in BL2SDK.h
* Cleanup VirtualProtects in DirectX hooking
* Get rid of macro indexes in DirectX hooking

* Fix indenting in Gwen DirectX renderer
* Replace slow DirectX font rendering with something faster
* Update texturing loading to load from SDK path rather than game path
* Remove unnessary functions from DirectX renderer for standalone shit
* Remove CLuaInterface and everything that goes with it (CLuaObject)
* Remove crap commands from main.cpp
* Add error exceptions in AntiDebug hook
* Remake GetFullName() to match the engine's GetFullName function
* Decide on hook halting in GameHooks.cpp
* Remake object searching to use the hash table

Lua
* Cursor enum for SetCursor
* Maybe move the dock enum to gwen table
* Implement checking that controls have not been freed before acting on them
* Figure out what the fuck is going wrong with UObjectIndex
* Allow for return values to be passed from a ProcessEvent hook back into the engine
* FFrame.GetFuncArgsHex possible infinite loop
* FFrameMT.GetTArray does not take into account TArray inner type
* A file reading/writing library
* Remove static directory references in sdkgen code
* Enums in function definition tables and comments of data structures
* Add Gwen to autoload on init
* Fix the problem with class fields being given their actual type instead of struct UClass*
* Upgrade to LuaJIT 2.0.2

Other
* CrashRpt endpoint on mcsi.mp
* CrashRpt privacy policy
* Lua/C++: Get the function flags right for ProcessEvent
* Set a console key automatically in launcher
* Add launcher facility to decompress upk files for opening in UE Explorer
* Lua/C++: Add hook in Lua for when ResetLua is happening
* Lua/C++: Allow Lua to call ResetLua (for sdkgen)
* Lua/C++: Pass unrecognized commands to Lua command system
* Figure out a way to detect if new SDK needs to be generated (I'm thinking hash of Borderlands2.exe?)
* Organise the SDK folder a bit better -subfolder for gwen textures etc.
* Find some way to move Launcher source code out of the build folder
* Decide whether to release source code (If so, hide some Unreal structs that I really shouldn't know)
* If releasing source, decide on licence
* Look into a build server and symbol server for crash reporting
* Test Steam version

Bugs:
* Console output doesn't work on the Steam version, this is because the SDK on the C++ side of things is using constant indexes for the engine functions, which was generated for the old version of the game. So either get the engine functions on the C++ side to use function names, or just move the concommand system completely into Lua.
