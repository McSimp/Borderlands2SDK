C++
* Create a nicer way to export Lua functions
* Detach detours? Is this even worth doing?
* Automatic version in BL2SDK.h
* Cleanup VirtualProtects in DirectX hooking
* Get rid of macro indexes in DirectX hooking
* Fix hook system - use pointers to avoid map copies
* Fix the MAJOR PROBLEM in hook system - probably can just search for the virtual function on deletion
* Work out a way to intercept LuaJIT exiting during a failed callback
* Get rid of Sigscan macros
* Remove Windows console and just use game/logfile
* Benchmark and analyse Widen/Narrow functions
* Oh my god what the fuck is going on in ConCmdManager.cpp
* Could neaten commands in LuaCommands.cpp
* Delete SlotMachines commands when done with them
* Replace slow DirectX font rendering with something faster
* Remove CLuaInterface and everything that goes with it (CLuaObject)
* Remove crap commands from main.cpp
* Remake GetFullName() to match the engine's GetFullName function
* Decide on hook halting in GameHooks.cpp
* Remake object searching to use the hash table
* The whole namespace thing is getting a bit messy, might need to think about using a class

Lua
* Cursor enum for SetCursor
* Maybe move the dock enum to gwen table
* Implement checking that controls have not been freed before acting on them
* Figure out what the fuck is going wrong with UObjectIndex
* Allow for return values to be passed from a ProcessEvent hook back into the engine
* FFrame.GetFuncArgsHex possible infinite loop
* FFrameMT.GetTArray does not take into account TArray inner type
* A file reading/writing library
* Remove static directory references in sdkgen code
* Enums in function definition tables and comments of data structures
* Create file structure for sdkgen automatically
* Get the SDKGen to run on coroutines so maybe we can render something to tell the user about the sdk generating

Other
* CrashRpt endpoint on mcsi.mp
* CrashRpt privacy policy
* Lua/C++: Get the function flags right for ProcessEvent
* Set a console key automatically in launcher
* Add launcher facility to decompress upk files for opening in UE Explorer
* Lua/C++: Add hook in Lua for when ResetLua is happening
* Lua/C++: Pass unrecognized commands to Lua command system
* Organise the SDK folder a bit better -subfolder for gwen textures etc.
* Find some way to move Launcher source code out of the build folder
* Decide whether to release source code (If so, hide some Unreal structs that I really shouldn't know)
* If releasing source, decide on licence
* Look into a build server and symbol server for crash reporting
* Test Steam version
* If Lua modules fail to initialize, give a more prominent warning

Bugs:
* Gwen canvas will resize, but game will lock up completely if resize and there has been a Gwen window on the screen at any point
* Gwen cursor does not work correctly in full screen - I think it's fine in borderless windowed though
